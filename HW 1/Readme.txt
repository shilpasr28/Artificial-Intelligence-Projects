The implementation for Breadth First Search, Depth First Search and Uniform Cost Search Algorithms are coded in Hw 1.py using Python 2.7.

The input and output files use UNIX line endings (“\n”).

Run HW 1.py using the command python HW 1.py –i < inputFile>, where < inputFile> is the filename of the input file that your program needs to read.

The output is displayed in 'output.txt'.
