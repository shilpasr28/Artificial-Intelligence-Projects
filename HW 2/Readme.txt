The implementation for Game Simulation using alpha-beta pruning algorithm and arc-consistency is coded in Hw2.py (Python 2.7).

The input and output files use UNIX line endings (“\n”).

Run HW2.py using the command python HW2.py –i < inputFile>, where < inputFile> is the filename of the input file that your program needs to read.

The output is displayed in 'output.txt'.
